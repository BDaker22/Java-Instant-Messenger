# Java-Instant-Messenger
#####Java Instant Messenger Client and Server programs for the SEIS635 Group Project

This Java Instant Messenger was created for SEIS635-01 Software Analysis and Design.  It is built in pure Java and is separated into two separate programs: a server program that cares for all server functionality and a client program that can be used to connect to the client and send messages to other client programs.  Both programs contain a GUI that utilizes Swing.

**Important Note:** This project was constructed for *academic* purposes only and is not a secure method for transmitting messages.
